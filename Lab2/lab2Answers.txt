1. With very few hidden nodes, the network has low capacity → underfitting → low accuracy.  
   As hidden nodes increase, the model can capture more complex decision boundaries → accuracy improves.  
   With too many hidden nodes, the model may overfit the training set. Accuracy stops improving significantly.

2. Accuracy rises quickly when moving from very few nodes (1–3) to moderate (4–20).  
   After ~20 nodes, the accuracy curve **plateaus** → adding more nodes does not bring major gains.  
   At very large hidden sizes, results may fluctuate slightly due to overfitting or randomness.
